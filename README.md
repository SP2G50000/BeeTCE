# BeeTCE
BeeTCE (**Bee**mod **T**o **C**ommunity **E**dition) is a tool to take Portal 2 Puzzlemaker Maps and compile them Portal 2: Community Edition, so they take full advantage of P2CE's upgraded engine.

Currently both this tool and Portal 2: Community Edition are in their infancy, as such, this tool is not ready for end-user use.

Proper instructions for using this tool will be provided at a later date.

## Using the application.
Download both Python scripts and put them in a folder together.

In order to use this program, you need Python 3 and [PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/) installed.

Once this is done, open `runme.py` and the program should run.
